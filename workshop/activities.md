# Activities

## Make a documentation using Markdown

Using **Markdown**, take a technology which can be a *language*, a *framework*, an *editor* or *IDE*... and make a documentation of your learning process. You can take as an examples my other repos such as:

- [C](https://github.com/CesarJZO/C)
- [Web](https://github.com/CesarJZO/Web)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/CesarJZO/Visual-Studio-Code)
- [Linux](https://github.com/CesarJZO/Linux)

You need to have a simple repo with a single branch at least, and some commits.

## Take an existing project

Take an **existing** project you have, it can be a *homework*, a *personal project* (website, simple app...) or a set of multiple *files of a language*. The thing is that it **cannot** be an empty directory.

This repository needs to have **multiple branches** and some
**merges** between them. Preferably, make changes with *merge conflicts*.

## Team work

Finally, make a repository, it could be from scratch or an ongoing project, but you need to work as a team. It is essentially the same activity as the previous one. Make multiple branches and merges.

## Send your work

Create a fork of this repository, clone it to your local machine and make a branch named `activities` 

```bash
git clone <url_forked_repo>
```

```bash
git checkout -b activities
```

Then, create Markdown file with the following format named `<first_name last_name.md>` inside the `activities` directory, where mine is stored:

```md
# <your name>

A brief description

[Link](<url_to_your_repo>) your repositories
```

You can add captures or whatever you want to **your** file.

After you made four file, `commit` and `push` those changes to your *forked* repo. Then make a **pull request**.
